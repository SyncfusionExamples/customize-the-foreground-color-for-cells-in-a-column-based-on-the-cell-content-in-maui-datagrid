# Customize the Foreground color for cells in a column based on the cell content in Maui DataGrid
The .NET MAUI DataGrid (SfDataGrid) displays all the text values in DataGridCell with a default TextColor. However, SfDataGrid allows you to customize the TextColor color of the DataGridCell for the entire view and to some specific cells based on conditions. 
You can use the SfDataGrid.DefaultStyle property to change the TextColor of all DataGridCell in the view. To find out more, please refer to our documentation.
If you need to change the TextColor of a cell based on its value, you can use the CellStyle property in the DataGridColumn. You can create converters for the style properties to meet your requirements.
## C#
Refer the below code example for writing a converter to customize the cell TextColor based on conditions.
```C#
public class ColorConverter: IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter,CultureInfo culture)
    {
        int _value = (int)value;
        if (_value >= 45)
            return Colors.Green;
        return Colors.Red;
    }
    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        return value;
    }
}
```
## XAML
Refer the below code example in which TextColor of the ManagerID column is customized based on conditions written in the converter. 
```XAML
<ContentPage.Resources>
  <ResourceDictionary>
    <local:StyleConverterForMarks x:Key="result"/>
  </ResourceDictionary>
</ContentPage.Resources>

<syncfusion:DataGridNumericColumn MappingName="ManagerID">
    <syncfusion:DataGridNumericColumn.CellStyle>
        <Style TargetType="syncfusion:DataGridCell">
            <Setter Property="TextColor"
        Value="{Binding ManagerID,Converter={StaticResource result}}" />
        </Style>
    </syncfusion:DataGridNumericColumn.CellStyle>
</syncfusion:DataGridNumericColumn>
```
